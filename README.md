## Project Overview

This project implements a **real-time trade cost estimator and orderbook analyzer** for cryptocurrency futures trading on the OKX exchange. It connects to OKX's Level 2 orderbook WebSocket feed for the BTC-USDT-SWAP instrument and processes streaming data to estimate various components of trade cost:

* Slippage (linear or quantile regression-based)
* Trading Fees (tier-based)
* Market Impact (Almgren-Chriss model)
* Maker/Taker Proportions (logistic regression)
* Internal system latency measurement

The system provides actionable insights for traders aiming to optimize execution costs in a highly dynamic market environment.

---

## Features

* **WebSocket Client:** Connects securely to OKX's L2 orderbook WebSocket endpoint (`wss://ws.gomarket-cpp.goquant.io/ws/l2-orderbook/okx/BTC-USDT-SWAP`) with SSL/TLS support.
* **Real-time Orderbook Processing:** Parses incoming JSON orderbook snapshots, extracts bid/ask prices and volumes at multiple levels.
* **Slippage Estimation:** Computes expected slippage using linear or quantile regression models based on historical data and live orderbook states.
* **Fee Calculation:** Calculates trading fees based on user-selected fee tiers (maker/taker rates).
* **Market Impact Estimation:** Implements Almgren-Chriss framework to estimate market impact costs given trade size and market conditions.
* **Net Cost Calculation:** Aggregates slippage, fees, and market impact for total estimated trade cost.
* **Maker/Taker Proportion Estimation:** Uses logistic regression models to estimate the likelihood that a trade is maker or taker based on orderbook features.
* **Latency Measurement:** Measures internal processing latency with timestamping on each data tick to monitor system performance.

## Component Details

### 1. Slippage Estimation

Uses linear or quantile regression trained on historical orderbook snapshots to estimate expected price slippage for a given trade size.
Training Function:

slope = (n * sumXY - sumX * sumY) / (n * sumX2 - sumX * sumX); intercept = (sumY - slope * sumX) / n; This is standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression for predicting slippage based on quantity:

slippage(Q)=slope‚ãÖQ+intercept 
Q: Order quantity

slope, intercept: Fitted using past trade data

Rationale:
* Lightweight and interpretable
* Fast computation for real-time simulation
* Easy to retrain with new data


### 2. Fee Calculation

Computes fees based on pre-configured fee tiers (maker and taker rates). The fee tiers can be user-selected or fetched from exchange parameters.
Code Logic:

switch (tier) { case FeeTier::Tier1: return amountUSD * 0.001; case FeeTier::Tier2: return amountUSD * 0.0007; case FeeTier::Tier3: return amountUSD * 0.0005; default: return amountUSD * 0.001; } Formula:

fee=amountUSD√ótier_rate Where:

Tier 1 = 0.10%

Tier 2 = 0.07%

Tier 3 = 0.05%

This structure mimics real-world centralized exchange fees and allows easy modification for future rule-based logic.

### 3. Market Impact Estimation

Implements Almgren-Chriss market impact model considering trade size, volatility, and liquidity metrics derived from the orderbook.
Formula Used:

return volatility * std::sqrt(quantity / timeHorizon); Mathematical Form:

slippage(Q)=slope‚ãÖQ+intercept‚Äã


Where:

ùúé: Market volatility (passed as parameter)

ùëÑ: Order quantity

ùëá: Time horizon over which execution occurs

This simplified form of the Almgren-Chriss model estimates the temporary market impact of executing a trade. It reflects that larger and quicker trades result in higher impact.

### 4. Net Cost Calculation

Aggregates all cost components (slippage + fees + market impact) for a final estimated cost figure.

### 5. Maker/Taker Proportion Calculation

Estimates the probability of a trade being maker or taker using logistic regression on features such as orderbook imbalance, spread, and recent trade activity.

### 6. Internal Latency Measurement

Records timestamps for each received tick and processing step to measure latency and ensure real-time performance.
Latency Benchmarking Goals Metric Target Latency Description Data processing latency < 5 ms From tick receipt to model output UI update latency < 10 ms ImGui + OpenGL redraw cycle Simulation loop latency < 15 ms Fee + Slippage + Impact combined

### 7. WebSocket Real-Time Data Streaming

Secure WebSocket client implementation connects to OKX‚Äôs L2 orderbook endpoint, receiving snapshots of bids and asks continuously and updating estimations accordingly.

## Usage

* Run the program, which connects to OKX's WebSocket endpoint and prints incoming orderbook snapshots.
* The program calculates slippage, fees, market impact, and net cost per tick in real-time.
* Modify input parameters or regression models inside the source code as needed.
* Integrate with a frontend via WebSocket or REST API to expose real-time analytics.
